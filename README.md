My first Gradle Project

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/kaanuzunpinar/FirstGradle.svg?branch=main)](https://travis-ci.com/kaanuzunpinar/FirstGradle)

In this project, i programmed a simple website that doing simple calculation with java. under
/compute domain there is a tool which firstly calculates mean of 3 numbers that entered right box
then it prints how many numbers in the left box is bigger then the mean.

I used Mustache and Spark.
Below you can find a sample site which i created with continuous integration and continuous deployment.
For this sample i used Heroku and Travis
