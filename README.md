My first Gradle Project for Introduction to Software Engineering Class

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/kaanuzunpinar/FirstGradle.svg?branch=main)](https://travis-ci.com/kaanuzunpinar/FirstGradle)

In this project, i programmed a simple website that doing simple calculation with java. under
/compute domain there is a tool which firstly calculates mean of 3 numbers that entered right box
then it prints how many numbers in the left box is bigger then the mean. Note that numbers must be seperated by NewLine(\n) character in both boxes.

I used Mustache and Spark.
Below you can find a sample site which i created with continuous integration and continuous deployment.
For this sample i used Heroku and Travis
